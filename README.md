# k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Implementation

## Abstract
This C project implements the k-NN algorithm to identify the nearest neighbors of a set of query points \( Q \) relative to a corpus set \( C \) in a high-dimensional space. 
Given a corpus of \( c \) points and \( q \) query points, both in \( d \)-dimensional space, the algorithm efficiently determines the k-nearest neighbors for each query point. 
The implementation leverages optimized matrix operations, parallel processing, and approximation techniques to handle large datasets and high-dimensional distance calculations efficiently.

## Testing
PC specs: Intel Pentium Silver N5030 (4 cores, 4 threads), RAM (4GB), Arch Linux

## Benchmarks
TODO
